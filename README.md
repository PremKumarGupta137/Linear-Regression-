# Linear Regression - Least Squares Method
Overview
This repository contains an implementation of Linear Regression using the Least Squares Method. The Least Squares method is a mathematical optimization technique used to find the line of best fit for a set of data. This implementation predicts a continuous target variable from one or more independent variables.

The project demonstrates Simple Linear Regression (one independent variable) and Multiple Linear Regression (multiple independent variables) using the Least Squares method for solving the linear equation.

# Features
Simple Linear Regression: Implements the model for predicting a target variable based on one independent variable.
Multiple Linear Regression: Extends the approach to handle multiple independent variables.
Model Evaluation: Uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to evaluate the fit of the model.
Data Preprocessing: Handles data scaling and splitting into training and testing datasets.
