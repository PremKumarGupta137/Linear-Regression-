Linear Regression - Machine Learning
Overview
This repository contains an implementation of Linear Regression, a fundamental algorithm in machine learning for predictive modeling. Linear Regression aims to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

This project demonstrates both simple linear regression (one independent variable) and multiple linear regression (multiple independent variables). The implementation is done using Python and popular libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.

Features
Simple Linear Regression: Predicting a continuous target variable based on one independent variable.
Multiple Linear Regression: Predicting a target variable based on multiple independent variables.
Visualization: Visualizes the regression line and model fit using Matplotlib.
Evaluation Metrics: Implements common evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, etc.
Data Preprocessing: Includes basic data cleaning and feature scaling where necessary.
